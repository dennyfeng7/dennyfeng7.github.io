            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I worked for JPMorgan Chase as a Lead Associate Operations for four years, from June 2014 to July 2018. During my tenure there I was in charge of the operations for five different branches in the Downtown Flushing, Queens market. In each branch, I led and trained teams of 10-60 employees in accordance to our firm's policy and procedures, anti-money laundering guidelines, fraud detection. During the Summer of 2018, I decided to go back to academia to pursue my lifelong interest in software engineering. I enrolled in my first computer science classes the following semester.</p>
                <p>As a young, intrigued kid, my passion was always in computers. My first inspiration came from my uncle who was an engineer in a China-based manufacturing company. He led design and engineer teams for the automotive industry overseas. He taught me how technology worked. At the time, the internet had made huge strides in innovation. I learned about communication through the internet with strangers who shared similiar hobbies of mine - playing video games such, as Runescape and World of Warcraft. To communite with them, I built my first HTML-based website and forum board, at the age of 14 through a web-hosting service called Invision. There, our friends were able to set up internet meetings. Creating the website and forum boards were the highlight of my teenage years. After having experienced the finance industry, I am glad to be back at working with software engineering and development. I look forward to working with exciting teams and bringing forth innovation.</p>
